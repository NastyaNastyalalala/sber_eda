## Results:
- EDA analysis
- Correlation analysis (removed columns where the correlation is > 0.9)
- Converting categorical columns
- Outlier analysis
- Work with the date (TimeSeriesSplit)
- LinearRegression as a baseline
- Data segmentation

###How else can the model be improved? A few areas to think about:
- Train other models
- Add macro indicators to the dataset
- Generate new features from existing ones (not simple encoding)
- Conduct a more in-depth EDA analysis
